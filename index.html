        <p>
          As a highly motivated 4th year Software System Engineering student at the University of Regina, 
          I am deeply passionate about building Machine Learning models and contributing to the Open Source community.
          I am constantly seeking opportunities to develop my skills and gain valuable experience in the field of Software Engineering. 
          At this point in my academic career, I am eager to secure an internship that will allow me to further refine my abilities and contribute 
          to meaningful projects. Check out my projects <a href="https://github.com/BinaryQuBit">here</a>.
