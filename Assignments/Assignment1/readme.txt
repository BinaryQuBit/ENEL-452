The program filter.cpp is a program that does a complex calculations. It can compute and also handle errors based on the errpr type. There are four errors it handles as per the document.

To run the program;
make
./filter.cpp

All the tests are being passed now. I have updated the code according to the updated runtest.py test cases by Karim Naqvi.

Files involved:
filter.cpp - main logic
Makefile - to build
readme.txt - info on the program
test.txt - to pass a batch through program
